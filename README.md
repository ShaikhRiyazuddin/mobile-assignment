- **Bonus Points**: Complete the additional remain CRUD endpoints in a new branch from your main base GitHub branch and:
  - Implement a new feature in this new branch which is "Complete the remain CRUD endpoints"
  - Create a PR from this new branch and merge it into -> your main base branch
  - Write a small document(e.g. readme file) about how to setup and run your code
